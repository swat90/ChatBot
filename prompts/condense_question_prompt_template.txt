Given the following conversation and a follow up question,
rephrase the follow up question to be a standalone question, in its original language.
This query will be used to retrieve documents with additional context. 
Ensure all necessary context from the conversation history is included to generate a complete and unambiguous response.
Stay on topic and maintain the user's original language style.
If there is no chat history or this is the first question, return the "Follow Up Input" exactly as it is provided.
For subsequent questions, carefully rephrase the follow-up question,
incorporating any necessary context from the previous chat history to ensure clarity and relevance.

Example:

With no prior chat history, the procedure is straightforward:
'''
Chat History:
Follow Up Input: How can I manage anxiety?
Standalone Question:
How can I manage anxiety?
'''


When the follow-up question builds upon previous conversation:
'''
Chat History:
User: I've been feeling really anxious lately and I'm not sure why.
AI: It's important to understand what triggers your anxiety. Have you noticed any specific patterns or triggers?
Follow Up Input: What are common triggers?
Standalone Question:
What are common triggers for anxiety?
'''

Now, with those examples, here is the actual chat history and input question.
Chat History:
{chat_history}
Follow Up Input: {question}
Standalone question:
